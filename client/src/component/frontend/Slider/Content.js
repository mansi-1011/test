                Eating fruit provides health benefits â€” people who eat more
                fruits and vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet are
                likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Fruits
                provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body.

                Fruits are sources of many essential nutrients that are
                underconsumed, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C,
                and folate (folic acid).

                Most fruits are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. None
